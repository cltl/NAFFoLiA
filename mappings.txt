NAF                     FoLiA
=================================================================================
NAF/@xml:lang           meta[@id="language"]    (if native metadata is used and if available at all, not mandatory in FoLiA)
NAF/@version            FoLiA/@version          mandatory in both (describes format version in both, not document version)
n/a                     FoLiA/@xml:id           ID of the document, mandatory, may correspond to NAF/public/publicID? But is optional in NAF
NafHeader               metadata/annotations
fileDesc                metadata[@type="native"]
fileDesc/@title  (opt)  meta[@id="title"] (opt)
fileDesc/@author (opt)  meta[@id="author"] (opt)

fileDesc/@X             meta[@id="X"]
n/a                     meta[@id="Y"]   
 -> FoLiA native metadata is a simple key->value store. Can attributes be added at will to fileDesc in NAF?

public/publicId (opt)   FoLiA/@xml:id or a metadata entry (meta)
public/uri (opt)        a metadata entry (meta)

linguisticProcessors    metadata/annotations
 -> Each FoLiA annotation type has a corresponding declaration element, which can set annotator/annotatortype (i.e the processor), timestamps are set individually on the annotations rather than on this level. @version would just be part of @annotator in FoLiA, @hostname is not supported.

raw  (opt)              text/@t (opt)    can contain the entire text of the document, text can be embedded/reduplicated on every structure level in FoLiA if desired

topics/topic             text/domain
 @source                 @annotator
 value or @uri           @class
 @method                 feat[subset="@method"]   (not prescribed by FoLiA, use feature mechanism)
-> domain annotation can occur within any structural element in FoLiA, it needs not cover the whole text

text/wf                 text//w
 @id                    @xml:id
 n/a                    @class (opt, set-dependent, ucto for instance assigns classes like "WORD", "PUNCTUATION", "URL")
 n/a                    @space (value defaults to "yes", can be "no", used to reconstruct untokenised text)
 @sent                  (Is explicit in the structure)
 @length                Is implicit from text content (@t)
 @offset                @offset  (but usually left implicit, can be recomputed by library if need be)
                        @ref     offset is relative to this element (default: text content of parent element)
 value                  t        (text content element)
-> FoLiA w elements (words/tokens) occur in their hierarchical structural context (for instance within a sentence [s], paragraph [p], division [div], etc...) rather than as a flat itemisation. Maintaining document structure is one of the defining characteristics of FoLiA.

terms/term              text//w   (see note at end)
 @id                    @xml:id  
 @type (opt)            n/a  (closed/open vocabularies are property of the set definition, for instance for lemma-annotation)
 @pos  (opt)            pos/@class    [actual classes (i.e. tagset) never prescribed by FoLiA, depends on used set definition]
 @lemma   (opt)         lemma/@class 
 @morphofeat  (opt)     morphology  (complex layer in FoLiA, not a single attribute!) 
 @case (opt)            should be feature of pos (set-dependent), e.g. pos/@feat[subset="case"] 
-> FoLiA does not make the token/term distinction like NAF does. The w element can be considered more like a term and it is not prohibited to have spaces in its text (technically multiple tokens). Alternatively, some types of terms may be represented as FoLiA entities.


sentiment               text//subjectivity    (I'm not too happy about the FoLiA tag name, 'sentiment' would be better but this has existed historically (used in VU-DNC for instance), considering renaming in FoLiA v1.2)
 @resource              @set (i.e, a FoLiA Set Definition covering the vocabulary)
 @polarity              @class or feat/[@subset="polarity"] ?
 @strength              @class or feat/[@subset="strength"] ?
 @subjectivity          @class or feat/[@subset="subjectivity"] ?
 @sentiment_semantic_type         @class or feat/[@subset="semantic_type"] ?
 @sentiment_modifier              @class or feat/[@subset="modifier"] ?
 @sentiment_product_feature       @class or feat/[@subset="product"] ?
-> This is a bit underdeveloped in FoLiA. I think we can pre-define some subsets based on NAF attributes (polarity/strength/subjectivity/smeantic_type/modifier) for FoLiA v1.2 (which implies they can be used directly as attributes)


externalRef             alignment
@reftype                @class   (type of reference/alignment/relation) [set-dependent]
@resource               @xlink:href  (expected to be a proper URI pointing to the resource in FoLiA)
@reftype                @format     [proposed for FoLiA v1.2: expresses the format of the resource as a mime type]
@reference              aref/@id  (alignment links to the external resource, the aref alement points inside it if necessary)
@status                 use a feat
@source                 @annotator
@confidence             @confidence
-> In FoLiA, do not include alignments to point to the external source of any classes, this is solved in the Set Definition instead using the conceptlink.


term/component          w/morphology/morpheme
 (see NAF:term  and FOLIA:text//w)
-> Compound terms are considered as part of morphology in FoLiA

markables/mark          //entities/entity  (annotation layer can be embedded in any structural element)
@source                 @set
-> Entities can be used fairly generically for many purposes in FoLiA


deps/dep                //dependencies/dependency  (annotation layer can be embedded in any structural element)
@from                   hd/wref/@id  (Head of the dependency relation, refers back to a w, multiple wrefs allowed)
@to                     dep/wref/@id (Dependent in the dependency relation, refers back to a w, multiple wrefs allowed)
@rfunc                  @class  [set-dependent]


constituency/tree       syntax/su  (su is short for syntactic unit)
nt/@label               su/@class  [set-dependent]
t/span/target           su/wref    (multiple wrefs allowed)
edge                    (expressed by XML structure)


chunks/chunk            chunking/chunk
span/target             wref

entities/entity         entities/entity
@id (req)               @xml:id (opt)
@type                   @class [set-dependent]
@source                 @annotator
references/span/target  wref
@head="yes"             embed wref(s) within hd 

coreference/coref       coreferences/coreferencechain
@type                   @class [set-dependent]
span                    coferencelink
target                  wref
@head="yes"             embed wref(s) within hd

opinions/opinion        n/a (only subjectivity element exists, can be considered for future implementation)

attribution/statement   n/a (can be considered for future implementation)

srl/predicate/role      semroles/semrole
@id                     @xml:id
@semRole                @class      [set-dependent]
@confidence             @confidence
span/target             wref            
-> In FoLiA, roles are not grouped at predicate level, can be considered for future implementation


Events as Coreference clusters      Would work in FoLiA as well

timeExpressions/timex3  Use entities and features

temporalRelations/tlink n/a (can be considered for future implementation)

factuality              n/a (can be considered for future implementation)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a non-exhaustive list of things that FoLiA contains but are currently not found in NAF, they can not be mapped:
 - extensive structure annotation (NAF only knows sentences and paragraph),
   FoLiA defines more structure elements (TEI-inspired), such as divisions, lists/listitems, figures/captions, tables, events (e.g tweets, chat messages etc), quotes, gaps, entries (e.g. dictionary entries), footnotes/references.
 - phonology, phonetic representations, linking to audio with time offsets
 - morphology (though to lesser extend covered by naf:term/@morphofeat and naf:term/component)
 - lexical semantic sense annotation (folia:sense element)
 - language identification (folia:lang element)
 - correction for any type of annotation (including orthography), including suggestions for correction (folia:correction)
 - error detection (marking of errors) (folia:errordetection)
 - alternatives for any time of annotation (including orthography) (folia:alt, folia:altlayers)
 - text markup/layout (styling, hyperlinks, linebreaks, whitespace, gaps) (folia:t-*, folia:br)
 - higher-order annotation of arbitrary substrings (folia:str)
 - metrics, the ability to associate some measure (key->value) with any annotation (folia:metric)
 - description, ability for a description to be associated with any annotation (folia:desc)
