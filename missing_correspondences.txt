This file provides an overview of information that is provided by only one of the formats.
It serves as a todo list for format updates; i.e. information that is not made explicit in
one of the formats, but is added by the conversion script is not presented here.

1. Term layer:

FoLiA only has a text layer, but this layer contains most information provided by the term layer.

Missing information:
	* the attribute 'type' with possible values 'open' and 'closed'.
		=> can be derived from pos (morphofeat or head); needs to be done for each possible set
	* particles that are separated from their stem in the token layer form (in principle) one term.
		=> not clear if the current modules producing NAF actually do this; to be examined once examples have been found.


2. Chunk layer:

Missing information:
	* the attribute 'head' indicating the head of the chunk. This is obligatory in NAF.
		=> conversion folia2naf adds the head if singleton; as soon as dependencies are covered, they will be used for larger chunks.

1. Text to text and terms:

Missing information:
	* <w/> NAF does not have a 'class' for words (either token or terms)
		=> see if this can be added in generic annotation scheme (see below)
	* <pos/> NAF places 'set' in header (if provided), confidence not an attribute for term for now
		=> propose as possible attribute (pos_confidence) to NAF partners
	* <pos/feat/> NAF does not provide this additional classification of components of the pos class.
		=> see if this can be added in generic annotation scheme (see below)
	* <morphology/> NAF currently does not support more finegrained morphological information
		=> to be investigated: design first proposal for adding 'morphology layer' to NAF

*****generic annotation scheme*****

NAF uses 'externalReferences' as a generic way to link mentions to interpretations in external resources (e.g. DBpedia, WordNet, FrameNet).
It has been discussed previously whether we can also use this mechanism to capture (e.g.) alternative analyses by PoS-taggers, etc.
We are currently looking into this. Possibly, this will become a variation of externalReferences (since the PoS is a grammatical property, 
rather than a meaning representation).


2. Chunk layer:

Missing information:
	* confidence attribute for chunks. This can be added, but we need to know what the confidence in FoLiA represents.

3. Entity layer:

Missing information:
	* confidence attribute for entity. This can be added for external references. Also possible to adapt NAF, but we need to clarify whether FoLiA confidence is about the label or identification+label.
