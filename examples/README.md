* ``potgrond.frog.folia.xml`` -- The output of a full run of Frog, using input ``potgrond.txt``. Documents such as these will be the most common FoLiA document. Corpora such as SoNaR and Basilex are largely formatted like this.
* ``nederlab-dpo.35.mpeg21.0300.alto.folia.corrected.folia.xml`` -- The output of TICCL, providing corrections on **untokenised** text and linking substrings to external ALTO documents. Multiple text layers are defined and related to eachother in this document.
* ``valkuil.folia.xml`` -- A simple example of the output of Valkuil. Contains suggestions for correction of orthography on tokenised text using the ``correction`` element, which is one of the more complex but powerful elements in FoLiA.
